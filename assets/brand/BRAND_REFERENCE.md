---

## One-liner (hero)

**EventFlux is a pattern-first stream processing engine (CEP) in Rust. Compose filters, joins, enrichment, windows, and complex event patterns—and run them in milliseconds, without the overhead of a heavyweight streaming platform.**

---

## Descriptions

### Short (50–60 words)

EventFlux is a Rust-native **stream processing engine** with **pattern processing built in**. Teams define filters, joins, enrichment, windows, and complex event patterns (CEP) and execute them with low latency on-prem or in Kubernetes. Designed to be small, fast, and operable—no broker or heavyweight platform required.

### Extended (120–150 words)

EventFlux is a compact, **pattern-first stream processing engine (CEP)** built in Rust for teams who need real-time computation without the complexity of a full streaming platform. Define pipelines that **filter**, **transform**, **join**, and **enrich** data; declare **windows** and **temporal patterns**; and emit actions or insights in **sub-10 ms**. EventFlux runs cleanly on-prem or in Kubernetes, integrates with common sources and sinks, and keeps operations simple with a minimal runtime, observable metrics, and deterministic behavior. Because it’s Rust-native, EventFlux delivers consistent latency and low memory overhead while avoiding long warmups or excessive GC tuning. Start small, scale as needed, and keep control of your data plane—**no broker lock-in, no bloat, just streaming logic that ships.**

---

## Positioning Statement

For engineering teams who need real-time detection and transformation without running a heavyweight platform, **EventFlux** is a **pattern-first stream processing engine** that delivers low-latency filters, joins, enrichment, windows, and CEP in a compact Rust runtime—operable on-prem or in Kubernetes—so you can go from events to action in milliseconds.

---

## Messaging Pillars

1. **Pattern-first by design**
   Complex event patterns (sequences, absence, correlation) are built into the engine—not bolted on.

2. **Rust-fast, predictable latency**
   Consistent performance and small footprint for edge and on-prem.

3. **Essential, not excessive**
   The stream processing you need—filters, joins, enrichment, windows—without platform bloat.

4. **Operate anywhere**
   Clean self-hosted experience and Kubernetes-friendly deployment.

5. **Composable & extensible**
   Connectors for common sources/sinks; pipelines are made of clear, reusable operators.

---

## Core Value Propositions

* **Detect in real time:** CEP sequences, absence, and time-bounded rules.
* **Enrich in flight:** Join external context without breaking latency budgets.
* **Control latency:** Sub-10 ms paths on common workloads.
* **Own your runtime:** On-prem and K8s ready; no broker lock-in.
* **Keep it simple:** Minimal moving parts; clear observability and deterministic behavior.

---

## Key Capabilities (copy for slides/website)

* Filters, maps, projections
* Stateful and stateless operators
* Stream-to-table and stream-to-stream joins
* Enrichment via external stores and caches
* Tumbling, sliding, session windows; watermarking and late-data handling
* CEP patterns: sequence, absence, correlation, time-bounded triggers
* Connectors for common sources and sinks (extensible)
* Exactly-once/at-least-once modes (where supported)
* Metrics and tracing hooks for observability

---

## Why Rust (talk track)

* **Predictable latency** (no GC pauses)
* **Memory safety** with low overhead
* **Small binaries & fast starts**
* **Edge/on-prem friendly** operations

---

## Audience & ICP (who this is for)

* **Platform/infra teams** that need real-time computing but not a full streaming platform.
* **Fraud/risk and security teams** that require pattern detection and correlation.
* **Observability/SRE teams** correlating events across services and time windows.
* **IoT/telemetry teams** processing sensor data with enrichment at the edge.

---

## Objection Handling (with crisp replies)

* **“Is this a broker?”** No—EventFlux is a **processing engine** that connects to your existing sources/sinks.
* **“Do I need Kafka/Pulsar?”** No, but EventFlux integrates cleanly if you have them.
* **“Is this just CEP?”** CEP is integrated, but EventFlux also handles general transforms, joins, enrichment, and windows.
* **“Will it run on-prem?”** Yes—self-hosted and Kubernetes deployments are first-class.
* **“Why not X big platform?”** If you need the platform, use it; if you need **results without bloat**, use EventFlux.

---

## Differentiators

* **CEP is native, not an add-on**
* **Rust performance without GC tuning**
* **Minimal surface area** vs. full platforms
* **Operator-centric mental model** (filters, joins, windows, patterns)
* **On-prem & edge-friendly** footprint

---

## Tone & Voice

* **Concrete > vague.** Say “filters, joins, enrichment, windows, patterns,” not “powerful insights.”
* **Confident, not loud.** Let proof points carry the message.
* **Builder-friendly.** Speak to engineers; avoid buzzwords.
* **Consistent category phrase.** Always pair **EventFlux** with **“stream processing engine (CEP)”** on first mention.

---

## Boilerplate (press/about)

**Short:**
EventFlux is a pattern-first **stream processing engine (CEP)** built in Rust. It turns events into action through filtering, joining, enrichment, windowing, and complex event patterns—at low latency and without the bloat of a heavyweight platform.

**Long:**
EventFlux is a compact, Rust-native **stream processing engine** that brings **pattern processing (CEP)** into the core runtime. Teams use EventFlux to compose filters, maps, joins, enrichment, windows, and temporal patterns, then execute them in milliseconds on-prem or in Kubernetes. With predictable performance, straightforward operations, and extensible connectors, EventFlux delivers the essentials of real-time computation—without platform lock-in or broker overhead.

### Usage Guidelines

* **High contrast required:** Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
* **Accent usage:** Use teal for primary CTAs and active states; use purple for secondary emphasis
* **Backgrounds:** Prefer `#F7F8F8` for main backgrounds; `#EEEEEE` for content cards or sections

## Logo Usage

### Logo Assets

* **Primary logo:** `logo.png` (full color, transparent background)
* **Minimum size:** 120px width for digital, 1 inch for print
* **Clear space:** Maintain minimum padding equal to the height of the "E" in "EventFlux" on all sides

### Usage Rules

* **Do:**
  - Use the logo on light backgrounds (`#F7F8F8`, `#FFFFFF`, `#EEEEEE`)
  - Maintain original aspect ratio
  - Ensure sufficient contrast with background
  - Use high-resolution versions for large formats

* **Don't:**
  - Distort, rotate, or alter the logo proportions
  - Add effects (shadows, glows, outlines)
  - Place on busy backgrounds that reduce legibility
  - Use low-resolution versions that appear pixelated
  - Change colors or recreate the logo

### Lockup Variations

* **With tagline:** Pair logo with "Pattern-First Stream Processing Engine (CEP) in Rust" for first-view placements
* **Standalone:** Use logo alone for navigation, favicons, and secondary placements where brand is established
